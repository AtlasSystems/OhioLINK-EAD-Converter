<bioghist encodinganalog="545"><head>History of Dorothy Day Center for Faith and Justice</head><p>Xavier University has demonstrated commitment to its Jesuit and Catholic heritage over the years. In 1981, Benjamin J. Urmston, S.J. proposed through the Vice President for Student Affairs to then Xavier University President Robert Mulligan, S.J., that the University have a department dedicated to faith and justice. He chose the name Peace and Justice Programs. In 1983, at the request of Xavier students, Xavier President Charles Currie designated Dorothy Day House as the home of Peace and Justice Programs and student clubs.</p><bioghist><p>The Division of Religious Development, as the Center for Mission and Identity was originally called, was established by President James E. Hoff, S.J. in March, 1992. Over the years the Center has had several different titles, including the Division of Mission and Ministry and finally, the Center for Mission and Identity in 2009. The Division of Mission and Ministry sponsored Campus Ministry, Peace &amp; Justice Programs and Ignatian Programs.</p><p>In these photographic scrapbooks we see the activities that Campus Ministry has provided for students, including prayer and reflection retreats, get-aways, and faith sharing groups. Peace and Justice Programs include activities which raise awareness of social issues as well as sponsor lectures by local, national and international peace and justice specialists. Dorothy Day House is home to a number of student clubs and organizations that are focused on issues of peace and justice, as is reflected by the scrapbook collection.</p></bioghist></bioghist><scopecontent encodinganalog="520$a"><head>Scope and Content</head><p>This collection consists of primarily photographic scrapbooks covering several Center for Faith and Justice and Campus Ministry  sponsored student activities from 1983 to 2004.
