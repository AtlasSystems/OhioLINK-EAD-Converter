<bioghist encodinganalog="545"><head>History of Xavier University President's Advisory Council</head><p>The President's Advisory Council was established in 1992 at the behest of Fr. James Hoff, the President of Xavier University. This council was to consist of those persons who had shown previous support and expressed interest in becoming more involved in the university through various means. Membership could include alumni, parents, and business or foundation representatives. Cultural diversity would be a character of the Council. The Council was divided into various sub-groups during its early years.   These sub-groups did change somewhat through the years, and the Council now meets as a full group twice a year.  The President's Advisory Council was chiefly to advise the President and other Xavier administrative officers (e.g. deans, program heads, etc.) who attended the meetings. The Council also was to help assist with university mission and goals, to give financial support to university needs, and to assist University Relations.</p><bioghist/></bioghist><scopecontent encodinganalog="520$a"><head>Scope and Content</head><p>This collection consists of various materials relating to the President's Advisory Council.
