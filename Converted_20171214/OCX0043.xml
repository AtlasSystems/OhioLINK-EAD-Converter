<bioghist encodinganalog="545"><head>History of Xavier University and Higher Learning Commission accreditation</head><p>Since Xavier University was initially accredited in 1925  by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools (now known as the Higher Learning Commission), the university has been regularly reviewed for re-accreditation.</p><bioghist><p>Xavier University is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools (HLC).   Xavier first joined the North Central Association of College and Schools, as the HLC was originally called, in 1925.  There have been regular comprehensive reviews of the Xavier since that time along with focused visits by a review team.  These occurred approximately every ten years. Accreditation was lost in 1934 for about one year over athletic issues pertaining principally to the football program, but it has been held continuously since 1935.   Until the late 1990s, the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association of Colleges and School was simply referred to as the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools (NCA).   In earlier years, the official "visit" of the NCA review team, which took place every ten years, was sometimes referred to as the "Survey."  Similarly, the institutional Self-Study which Xavier now undergoes in preparation for the Visit was referred to as the "Schedules."</p></bioghist></bioghist><scopecontent encodinganalog="520$a"><head>Scope and Content</head><p>This collection includes correspondence, institutional self-studies, reports and other materials dealing with the accreditation of Xavier University by the Higher Learning Commission, previously known as the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools.</p><scopecontent/></scopecontent><arrangement encodinganalog="351$b"><head>Statement of Arrangement</head><p>The materials in the collection are arranged chronologically.</p></arrangement><separatedmaterial encodinganalog="544 0"><head>Separated Material</head><p>Electronic files dealing with Higher Learning Commission (North Central Association) accreditation can also be found on the Xavier University Archives storage drive.

O'Connor,S.J., acting on the recommendation of the Academic Council, appointed a committee "to recommend how we can best study the purposes of our instructional program. eventually we want a full statement of our objectives that will serve to guide curricular decisions and stimulate improvement of instruction." The work of this committee began in March 1957 and ended somewhere around mid-January, 1959. This folder contains, in chronological order, papers, documents, reports and surveys pertaining to the work of the committee. While this study was apparently done independently of the NCA visit, it clearly played a prominent role in Xavier's preparation for the visit. All of these papers were found among the materials pertaining to the NCA preparations of 1958.</p></scopecontent></c01><c01 level="file"><did><container type="Box">2</container><container type="Folder">6</container><unittitle>Papers Pertaining to Visit of May 1-2, 1958</unittitle><unitdate type="inclusive" normal="1958/1959" era="ce" calendar="gregorian">1958-1959</unitdate></did><scopecontent><p>In this folder: 1.
