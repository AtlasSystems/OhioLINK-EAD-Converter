<bioghist encodinganalog="545"><head>History of Xavier University Art Collection Committee</head><p>The Fine Arts Committee, as this committee was initially named, was created sometime in late 1949 or early 1950 and was discontinued at the end of the 1968-69 academic year.  It was reinstated in the summer of 1972 and was discontinued again in 1985.  In 1996 an ad hoc committee called the University Art Collection Committee was established by President Hoff.  It ceased to exist around 2001, never having been recognized as a permanent committee.</p><bioghist><p>In 1973-74 the charge of the committee read as follows:  "Appointed annually by the President and electing its own chairman, the Fine Arts Committee makes recommendations to the Vice President for Student Development on fine arts programs and exhibitions."
 In 1980-81 the charge read as follows:  "This committee has as its purpose to develop interest in the fine arts in the community and to draw up recommendations regarding fine arts, the Carriage House Gallery, art exhibits, the care, storing and sale of paintings and other artistic objects belonging to the University."
