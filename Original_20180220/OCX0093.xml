<bioghist encodinganalog="545"><head>History of American Association of University Professors (AAUP)- Xavier University Chapter</head><p>The American Association of University Professors (AAUP) is a professional organization devoted to representing college and university faculty members. The Xavier University Chapter of the AAUP was established sometime in late 1962, and remained active until around 1986. It joined the Ohio Conference of the AAUP in 1965. The chapter addressed issues concerning faculty benefits and salaries, tenure and rank requirements, university budget issues, and relationships among departments, faculty, administration, and students. The chapter actively researched collective bargaining options in the 1970s and early 1980s and engaged in discussions about the university's acquisition of Edgecliff College during the same time. On March 16, 2009, a group of faculty members restored the chapter and it  remained active for several years thereafter. At the time of the writing  of this finding aid (2017), University Archives is unaware of a formal  dissolution of the chapter although there is no evidence of its  continuance.</p><bioghist><p></p></bioghist></bioghist><scopecontent encodinganalog="520$a"><head>Scope and Content</head><p>The records are organized into two series and date from 1961-2011.
