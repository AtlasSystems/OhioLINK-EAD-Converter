<bioghist encodinganalog="545"><head>History of Xavier University President's Council</head><p>The origin of committees of the lay persons advising the university president is not clear.</p><bioghist><p>The origin of the Council is somewhat obscure. According to Dr. Roger Fortin's history of Xavier University, President Dennis Burns first appointed an "Advisory Board of Prominent Laymen" in the late 1930s "to offer the university advice on business matters." On the other hand, the Cincinnati Enquirer, in an article published in 1955, stated that the President's Council "succeeded the Xavier Lay Advisory Board, formed in January, 1947, by the Very Rev. Celestin J. Steiner, the president of the university."      However, from the papers in this collection, it seems clear that a committee of lay advisors to the president existed prior to 1947 under the name of "The Lay Advisory Council." Sometime around 1950, the name was changed to "The Lay Advisory Board," and in 1955 President Maguire renamed it "The President's Council." Around 1976 it went out of existence, probably because it no longer served its purpose, since more and more laymen were being appointed to the Board of Trustees.       The Council's constitution of April 22, 1955 defined its purpose as follows: "The purpose of the Council shall be to provide to the President a cabinet of advisers who through their personal prestige, their demonstrated leadership capacities and their broad business or professional experience are especially qualified to give counsel on important matters concerning the University." Membership was set at 15 in the same constitution.</p></bioghist></bioghist><scopecontent encodinganalog="520$a"><head>Scope and Content</head><p>This is a collection of records resulting from the activities of the Xavier University President's Council and its predecessor committees, the Lay Advisory Council and the Lay Advisory Board.
